## General

* get createWidget() properly working
* add options in widget (e.g. step, run/pause, restart)
* get seeds working
* color merging (unfinished cells)
* color schemes (e.g. night rail, rainbow) (color by distance)
* color by direction
* color by number of times visited
* Wilson's
* Houston's
* True Prim's

* braid mazes
* weave mazes
* other shapes (e.g. hexagonal mazes)

## Algorithms

* option to easily start for multiple points for algorithms such as recursive backtracker and simplified prims
* option for random functions such as perlin noise for deciding direction
